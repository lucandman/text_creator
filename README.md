# text_creator
- creates text from poem
- inspired by wu dao 2.0
- takes as input text and outputs 'similar' text
- cannot even be called nlp, language model used is probability
- inefficient
- next steps:
  - find better input text
  - make code more efficient
  - implement better algorithm for chosing next words
